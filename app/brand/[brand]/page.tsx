                    <p>
                        Rolex, the renowned luxury watchmaker, was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, England. Initially, the company was named “Wilsdorf and Davis,” and it focused on distributing timepieces.
                        Wilsdorf had a vision to create wristwatches that were both precise and elegant, which was a significant challenge at a time when pocket watches were the norm.

                        In 1908, the Rolex brand was registered, and the company name was officially changed to Rolex. Wilsdorf chose the name because it was short, easy to pronounce in any language, and could fit neatly on the dial of a
                        watch. To further enhance the reputation of Rolex for precision, the company moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1919.

                        Founded by Roland Schwertner in 1990, just months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, NOMOS Glashütte brought a fresh, modern perspective to the historic German watchmaking town. The brand is strictly dedicated to
                        mechanical watchmaking and builds its calibers in-house.

                        NOMOS is celebrated for its award-winning, minimalist aesthetics heavily inspired by the Bauhaus movement and the Deutscher Werkbund. Models like the Tangente and Orion have become modern classics, characterized by
                        clean typography, slender hands, and slim profiles.

                        Founded in 1848 by Louis Brandt in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Omega has been at the forefront of horological precision for over a century. They have been the Official Timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 and pioneered

                        Omega's historical significance is unmatched. The Speedmaster Professional famously became the first watch worn on the moon in 1969. Meanwhile, the Seamaster collection has been the watch of choice for deep-sea
                        explorers, military divers, and, famously, James Bond.
